      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Hello, and welcome to CS925! ðŸŽ‰</p>
      <p>
        We&apos;re thrilled that you&apos;ve decided to take the first step into
        the world of coding. Whether you&apos;re looking to build a new career,
        sharpen your skills, or simply explore the power of technology,
        you&apos;re in the right place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This bootcamp is designed <strong>especially for beginners</strong>â€”no
        prior programming experience needed! We&apos;ll start from the very
        basics and guide you through key concepts and practical skills
        step-by-step. Our hands-on approach ensures that you&apos;ll be writing
        your own code in no time and ultimately start building real projects to
        apply what you learn. Everyone goes at their own pace and this course
        will help accommodate that.

        As of this writing, there are a ton of great resources on this subject
        but the content is scattered or you consume the content and totally
        forget about it. I can't recall how many times I have gone through an
        online video, spent hours coding along and finish it only to forget what
        I did as it was too much of an information dump in too little time.
        However, in those resources, I always find little gems here and there
        and what I'd like to have this course be is to also consolidate those
        gems into one place.
